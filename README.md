# RU_Remote
An automated ssh drive mapper for Windows 10 that connects Ryerson Computer Science students. The Debian GNU/Linux servers known as collectively as "the moons" make up the departments main computing environment. When connecting to moon.scs.ryerson.ca, you will connect to either Elara, Thebe, Europa or Metis. This program automatically maps the server to a drive biased on your credentials using [WINFSP](https://github.com/billziss-gh/winfsp) and [SSHFS](https://github.com/billziss-gh/sshfs-win).
